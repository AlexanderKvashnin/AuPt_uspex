Structures of AuPt nanoclusters predicted by USPEX [[1](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-abstract/124/24/244704/567275/Crystal-structure-prediction-using-ab-initio?redirectedFrom=fulltext),[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010465512004055)]

The ground-state structures of PtAu clusters were obtained in a large compositional area using the variable composition technique [[3]](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpclett.8b03510)  for the global optimization of nanocluster structures implemented in the evolutionary algorithm USPEX. 

This method demonstrated 5â€“50 times higher speed than the traditional USPEX code for each composition [[4](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpclett.8b03510),[5](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2021/nr/d1nr05653k),[6](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2020/cp/d0cp05139j),[7](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpclett.3c01753)]
